## Live Node

In order to allow you to test your smart contracts easily, we are running a node and exposing it to internet for you. 
Take these values and use them on your project to run whatever tests you want to do.
```
NODE_URL="https://lotus-filecoin-experimental-fvm-dev.zondax.xyz/rpc/v1"
NODE_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJBbGxvdyI6WyJyZWFkIiwid3JpdGUiLCJzaWduIiwiYWRtaW4iXX0.OqMuzGRLfI97giJdk8HaxvWx0XKJdBP2XTm1addpgWo"
```

**Note:** _Please, remember this is development node, so we cannot guarantee it will be available all the time._ :clock1:

## Faucet 

In the next few weeks, we will provide a faucet. Until then, we are facilitating you with a pre-funded account, please be friendly :smile:

### Account with funds
You can use this account to sign the transactions required to install, instantiate and interact with your smart contracts.
