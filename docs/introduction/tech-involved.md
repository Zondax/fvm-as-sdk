These technologies are closely related to the FVM project and the SDK, so it is important for you to understand what they are about.

### What is WebAssembly?
The native runtime of the Filecoin Virtual Machine is WebAssembly (WASM). WebAssembly (abbreviated WASM) 
is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. WASM is designed as a portable compilation 
target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

Some of its features are:
- Efficient and fast
- Safe
- Open and debuggable
- Part of the open web platform

For more information, please refer to the [WebAssembly web page](https://webassembly.org).

### What is AssemblyScript?

AssemblyScript compiles a variant of TypeScript (a typed superset of JavaScript) to WebAssembly using Binaryen. 

- AssemblyScript targets WebAssembly's feature set specifically, giving developers low-level control over their code.
- Its similarity with TypeScript makes it easy to compile to WebAssembly without learning a new language.
