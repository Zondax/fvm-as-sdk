title: Filecoin Name Service (FNS)
sidebar_position: 2
---

This project is an example of a Filecoin Naming System actor written in AssemblyScript... and another smart contract 
you can learn about.

It implements:
- Save maps and integers to storage
- Load that data from storage
- Create a constructor
- Export methods with parameters and return values

In particular, this implements all the methods required to have a working name service, like ENS.
So this allows you to have your on name service running on FVM. Awesome, right?

**Notes:**
_Don't you know what a name service token is? Read this nice [article](https://docs.ens.domains) about it!_
