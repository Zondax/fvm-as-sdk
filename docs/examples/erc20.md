This is the another smart contract you should check in order to learn how to create your own one. :muscle:

It implements:
- Save maps, strings and integers to storage
- Load that data from storage
- Create a constructor with initial parameters
- Export methods with parameters and return values

In particular, this implements all the methods required by the ERC20 guidelines to create a token.
So this allows you to have your on token running on FVM. Awesome, right? :ok_hand:
