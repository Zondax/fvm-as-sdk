## Project Description

In the context of the FVM Early Builder program, we have built a set of tools to facilitate the use of AssemblyScript to write new smart contracts that will be compiled to WASM code at the end. WASM is what FVM uses to run smart contracts.

Nowadays, there are two other alternative SDKs for FVM smart contracts: Go and Rust. However, none of these languages is as popular and widely used as Javascript. AssemblyScript is part of the Javascript/Typescript family but it compiles to WASM.

To contribute to the growth of the ecosystem, it is valuable for FVM to allow users to write smart contracts using this language.
