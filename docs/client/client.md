## Handle lifecycle of your smart contract

### Install

To install a smart contract, you just need your binary file.

### Instantiate

To create a new instance of that smart contract, you need the ABI and the CID you get when installing the binary file.

### Interact

To interact with it, you need the ABI and one of two paths: the CID you get when installing the smart contract, or the address of your smart contract instance.
